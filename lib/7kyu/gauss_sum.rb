# GauÃŸ needs help! (Sums of a lot of numbers)
# problem statement: Due to another of his misbehaved, the primary school's teacher of the young GauÃŸ, Herr J.G. BÃ¼ttner, to keep the bored and unruly young schoolboy Karl Friedrich Gauss busy for a good long time, while he teaching arithmetic to his mates, assigned him the problem of adding up all the whole numbers from 1 through a given number n. Your task is to help the young Carl Friedrich to solve this problem as quickly as you can; so, he can astonish his teacher and rescue his recreation interval.

# example: f(n=100) -->returns 5050

def add(num)
  if(num.class == Integer and num > 0)
    sum  = (1..num).to_a.inject(:+)
    return sum
  else
    return false
  end
end
