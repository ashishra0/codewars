# Gauß needs help! (Sums of a lot of numbers)
# problem statement:
# Due to another of his misbehaved, the primary school's teacher of the young Gauß, Herr J.G. Büttner,
# to keep the bored and unruly young schoolboy Karl Friedrich Gauss busy for a good long time,
# while he teaching arithmetic to his mates, assigned him
# the problem of adding up all the whole numbers from 1 through a given number n.
# Your task is to help the young Carl Friedrich to solve this problem as quickly as you can;
# so, he can astonish his teacher and rescue his recreation interval.

# example: f(n=100) -->returns 5050
